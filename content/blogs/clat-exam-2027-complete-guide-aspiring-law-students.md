# CLAT Exam 2027: Complete Guide for Aspiring Law Students

Your comprehensive roadmap to understanding and preparing for India's premier law entrance examination.

If you're a student from Class 10, 11, 12, or a 12th-pass aspirant thinking about a career in law, chances are you've already heard about the CLAT Exam. But what exactly is CLAT? How difficult is it? And most importantly — how should you start preparing for CLAT 2027 from now?

## What Is the CLAT Exam?

CLAT or Common Law Admission Test is a national-level law entrance exam in India. This exam is designed for students who want to study law at National Law Universities (NLUs) and top law colleges in India. There are 26 NLUs in India accepting CLAT scores.

Think of it this way: Just as the IIT exam is given to get admission to IIT colleges and top engineering colleges, the CLAT exam is given to get admission to NLUs and best law colleges.

For most students, CLAT means:

- Entry into top law colleges
- A career as a lawyer, judge, corporate legal advisor, or policymaker
- Studying at prestigious NLUs like NLSIU Bangalore, NALSAR Hyderabad, NUJS Kolkata, and more

CLAT is conducted once a year and is highly competitive.

## Levels of the CLAT (Common Law Admission Test)

The Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) is conducted at two different levels to cater to students at different stages of their academic journey.

### 1. CLAT UG (Undergraduate)

The CLAT UG exam is meant for students who have completed, or are about to complete, their Class 12 education and wish to pursue a career in law. It offers an opportunity to gain admission into National Law Universities (NLUs) and other CLAT-participating colleges across India.

This exam is ideal for students who aspire to become lawyers and want to begin their legal education right after school. CLAT UG evaluates candidates on subjects such as English Language, General Knowledge and Current Affairs, Legal Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, and Quantitative Techniques.

A good score in CLAT UG opens the doors to some of the top law colleges in the country.

### 2. CLAT PG (Postgraduate)

CLAT PG is designed for students who already hold an undergraduate degree in law and are looking to pursue a Master of Laws (LLM) program. This exam focuses on advanced legal concepts and tests in-depth knowledge of various law subjects.

It is best suited for candidates who want to specialize in specific areas of law and deepen their understanding through higher studies.

# AILET 2026 Expected Cutoff: Category-Wise Score & Rank Prediction for NLU Delhi

A complete guide for BA LLB aspirants targeting NLU Delhi.

AILET is one of the toughest law entrance exams in India — not because the paper is extremely difficult, but because there is only ONE National Law University (NLU Delhi) and only 110–120 seats. With more than 1 lakh aspirants every year, the cutoff becomes a major deciding factor.

If you're preparing for AILET 2026, the biggest question on your mind right now is probably:

- "What will be the expected cutoff?"
- "How much should I score to get NLU Delhi?"
- "What were last year's cutoffs?"

Based on trends from AILET 2023–2025, difficulty patterns, and seat availability, here are the expected cutoffs for AILET 2026.

### AILET 2026 Expected Cutoff for BA LLB General Category

| Category | Expected Score | Expected Rank |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| General | 69–74 | Top 100–110 |

### OBC Category

| Category | Expected Score | Expected Rank |

### ST Category

| Category | Expected Score | Expected Rank |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| ST | 45–52 | Top 500–600 |

## Why These Expected Cutoffs? (AILET 2026 Analysis Breakdown)

Your AILET 2026 cutoff will depend on:

- Difficulty level of the exam (especially Logical Reasoning)
- Total number of test-takers
- Total seats at NLU Delhi (approx. 110–120 for BA LLB)
- Category-wise competition
- Change in exam pattern (if any)

Based on current trends, AILET continues to remain:

- **English** → Moderate
- **GK & Current Affairs** → Moderate (dominated by static + major events)
- **Logical Reasoning** → Moderate–Difficult

This pushes the expected safe score for General between 69–74.

## AILET 2025 Cutoff: Last Year's Official Closing Ranks

Let's look at the previous year's cutoff to understand the trend better.

### AILET 2025 BA LLB Cutoff (Official Ranks)

| Category | Closing Rank | Approx Score |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| General | 110 | 70–72 |
| OBC | 164 | 63–65 |
| EWS | 138 | 64–67 |
| SC | 458 | 52–55 |
| ST | 627 | 45–48 |

### Observation:

- AILET 2025 was slightly easier than AILET 2024 in English and GK.
- Logical Reasoning remained the toughest section.
- General cutoff climbed by 2–3 marks.

This is why AILET 2026 cutoff is expected to stay in the same range — unless the paper becomes unusually tough.

## AILET 2026 vs AILET 2025 — What's Changing?

| Factor | AILET 2025 | AILET 2026 (Expected) |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| Difficulty | Moderate | Moderate–Slightly Tough |
| GK Weightage | Balanced | Slight increase expected |
| LR | Trickier | Similar level expected |
| Competition | High | Higher due to early prep |
| Seats | 110–120 | 110–120 |

Cutoffs may rise by 1–2 marks only if AILET 2026 is easier. If tougher, cutoffs will drop slightly.

## Factors Affecting AILET 2026 Cutoff

### 1. Difficulty Level of LR

The LR section alone decides 60–70% of your rank.

### 2. Number of Test Takers

Every 5,000 additional aspirants increases General cutoff by 1 mark.

### 3. Category-Wise Seat Distribution

Seats are extremely limited → cutoffs are always high.

### 4. Nature of GK Section

- Static-heavy GK → lower cutoff
- Current-affairs heavy GK → higher cutoff

### 5. Normalization (If applied)

Mild fluctuations in scores can shift final ranks.

## AILET 2026 Rank vs Score Prediction

| Score | Expected Rank |
|-------|---------------|
| 75+ | Top 50 |
| 72–74 | Top 100 |
| 69–71 | Top 150 |
| 65–68 | Top 250 |
| 60–64 | Top 400 |
| 55–59 | Top 550 |
| 50–54 | Top 700 |

# Kickstart Your CLAT 2027 Journey: Free Strategy Webinar by CLAT Tribe

If you are planning to appear for the CLAT exam and targeting CLAT 2027, you might already be feeling confused about where to start. Should you begin with GK? Focus on Legal Reasoning? Join coaching? Or just keep reading newspapers?

Most students preparing for CLAT face the same problem — too many resources and no clear direction.

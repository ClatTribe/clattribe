# Best Law Colleges After CLAT 2026: Complete NLU Preference List Guide

Choosing the right law college after CLAT is one of the most important decisions of your academic life. Every year, thousands of students secure a decent CLAT rank but still regret their college choice—mainly because they didn't prepare a proper NLU preference list.

If you are a CLAT 2026 aspirant studying in Class 10, 11, 12, or already 12th pass, this detailed guide by CLAT Tribe will help you create your perfect NLU preference list with clarity, confidence, and logic.

## What Is an NLU Preference List & Why It Matters in CLAT Counselling?

After the CLAT results are declared, students must fill an NLU Preference List during the CLAT counselling process. This list decides which National Law University (NLU) you will be allotted based on:

- Your CLAT rank
- Your category & domicile
- The order of preferences you fill

Even with a good rank, a poorly arranged preference list can push you into a lower-ranked law college. That's why building a smart, realistic preference list is crucial for CLAT 2026.

## Factors to Consider Before Finalising Your NLU Preference List

Before jumping into rankings, every CLAT aspirant should consider these five key factors:

### 1. CLAT Rank vs Previous Cut-Offs

Always check:

- Previous year closing ranks
- Category-wise cut-offs
- Home-state reservations

This helps you set realistic expectations.

### 2. Placements & Internships

Top NLUs offer:

- Tier-1 law firm placements
- Strong internship support
- Exposure to corporate law, litigation, judiciary, and policy work

### 3. Faculty & Academic Reputation

Good faculty impacts:

- Moot court performance
- Research opportunities
- Higher studies (LLM in India or abroad)

### 4. Location & Exposure

NLUs in metro or semi-metro cities offer:

- Better internship opportunities
- Court exposure
- Networking events

### 5. Alumni Network & Campus Culture

A strong alumni base helps in:

- Job referrals
- Career guidance
- Long-term professional growth
